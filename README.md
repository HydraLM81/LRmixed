Short game that took way too long to make

<h2>Welcome to Labrynth Recall</h2>
This is a game in which things happen. I don't know what yet, because I don't know what it is. 

Repo name is Labrynth Recall Mixed because the code is both C++ and Python in a very not good way.

Using C++ as main computer and PyGame for display (and more), I've created a monstrosity that navigates with command-line and Windows.h sendinput useage.
For communication, shared memory wasn't quite working, so there's a text file that is read and written to repeatedly (and unefficiantly might I add).



As of original upload, it doesn't work because of python importing.
