# LR Python version
Short game that took way too long to make

<h2>Welcome to Labrynth Recall</h2>
This is a game in which things happen. I don't know what yet, because I don't know what it is. 

Repo name is Labrynth Recall Mixed because the code is both C++ and Python in a very not good way.

<h3>This is a remake of the original in Python</h3> 


<h1>NON-WORKING VERSION</h1>
(because there's no code to run)
